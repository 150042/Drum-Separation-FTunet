# Drum-Separation-FTunet
This is the code repository for a Drum Source Separation method FTunet, and we provide the FTunet's performance in SDR, compared with conventional models. We will update the core code and dataset soon!

## Results

- median SDR (dB) results of different models in separating different drum sounds.
